## Command retdec ##

`gef` uses the RetDec decompiler (https://github.com/avast/retdec)
to decompile parts of or entire binary. The command, `retdec`, also has a
default alias, `decompile` to make it easier to remember.

To use the command, you need to provide `gef` the path to a retdec installation. The compiled source can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/avast/retdec/releases) page. 

```
cd /opt
wget https://github.com/avast/retdec/releases/download/v4.0/retdec-v4.0-ubuntu-64b.tar.xz
tar xvf retdec-v4.0-ubuntu-64b.tar.xz
```

Then enter the path the `gef config` command:

```
gef➤ gef config retdec.retdec_path /opt/retdec
```

You can have `gef` save this path by saving the current configuration settings.

```
gef➤ gef save
```

`retdec` can be used in 3 modes:

   * By providing the option `-a`, `gef` will submit the entire binary being
     debugged to RetDec. For example,
```
gef➤ decompile -a
```

   * By providing the option `-r START:END`, `gef` will submit only the raw
     bytes contained within the range specified as argument.

   * By providing the option `-s SYMBOL`, `gef` will attempt to reach a specific
     function symbol, dump the function in a temporary file, and submit it to
     RetDec. For example,
```
gef➤ decompile -s main
```

## Syntax Highlighting

Retdec now supports syntax highlighting for all C decompilations with the use of Pygments.

Available themes can be found [here](https://github.com/pygments/pygments/blob/8e9f9cbec9ff496a1846602e32af27ffba52f5f7/pygments/styles/__init__.py).

You can change themes by running
```py
gef config retdec.theme THEME_NAME
gef save # remember to save your config!
```
