## Extra goodies for [`GEF`](https://github.com/hugsy/gef)

This is an open repository of external scripts and structures to be used by
[GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef). As GEF aims to stay a one-file battery-included plugin for
GDB, it doesn't allow by nature to be extended with external Python library. GEF-Extras remediates
that providing some more extensibility to GEF through:

-  more commands and functions
-  publicly shared structures for the `pcustom` command
-  more operating system support
-  more file format support


## Quick start

The biggest requirement for GEF-Extras to work is of course `GEF`. Please refer to GEF
documentation to have it set up (spoiler alert: it's pretty easy üòâ). Once GEF is up and running,
you can install GEF-Extras.

### Automated installation

Execute and run the installation script from GEF repository.

```bash
wget -q -O- https://github.com/hugsy/gef/raw/main/scripts/gef-extras.sh | sh
```

The script will download (via git) GEF-Extras, and set up your `~/.gef.rc` file so that you can
start straight away.

Refer to the [installation page](install.md) for more installation methods.


## Contribution

### Through Pull-Requests

This repository is open for anyone to contribute! Simply
[drop a PR](https://github.com/hugsy/gef-scripts/pulls) with the new command/function/feature. One
thing to note, GEF and GEF-Extras have become what they are today thanks to an up-to-date
documentation, so considering attaching a simple Markdown file to the `docs` folder explaining your
update. **IF** your code is complex and/or requires further scrutiny, adding CI tests would also be
asked during the review process of your PR.

For a complete rundown of the commands/functions GEF allows to use out of the box, check out
[GEF API page](https://gef.github.io/gef/api/) to start writing powerful GDB commands using GEF!

### Feature requests

Well, that's ok! Just create an [Issue](https://github.com/hugsy/gef-extras/issues) explaining what
cool feature/idea/command you had in mind! Even better, write the documentation (Markdown format)
for your command. It'll make easier for people who wants to integrate it!
